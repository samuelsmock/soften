                        alongside my bodywork practice, i also work as a caregiver for the elderly, specializing in end-of-life care. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        as the body begins to shut down, palliative care can help to ease a personâ€™s transition into the unknown.
                        my experience in this field has shown me that it can be helpful for a dying person to have an ally in their walk toward death, 
                        who is not a medical provider or family member.
                        <br/><br/>
                    </p>

                            i work with the body through gentle massage, as well as in the emotional sphere,
